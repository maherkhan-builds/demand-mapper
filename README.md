# Skill_Scanner

**Industry:** Education / EdTech / Career Intelligence  
**Part of AI App Challenge-Building one AI app per day using vibe-coding (prompt → prototype), focused on one industry problem at a time.**

## The Problem

Students spend months (or years) learning skills that are losing market value. Education paths don’t update fast enough, and most career guidance is generic. As AI reshapes industries quickly, students need a way to check whether their current learning plan is becoming outdated—and what to learn next based on real market signals.

## The Solution

**Skill Scanner** is a student-friendly, Gen Z-attractive AI app that scans a student’s current and planned learning path, detects skill obsolescence, and maps it against projected **5-year job demand**. It outputs clear, personalized recommendations to upgrade the learning plan with confidence.

## Skill Scanner Insights

- **Obsolescence Scan** – Flags skills that are declining or likely to lose demand  
- **Emerging Skills Feed** – Highlights rising skills tied to real job market shifts  
- **5-Year Demand Snapshot** – Shows demand direction (up/down) for skills and roles  
- **Skill Gap Map** – Identifies missing high-demand skills based on the student’s goal  
- **Plan Upgrade Recommendations** – Suggests swaps: *replace X with Y*, with a short “why”  
- **Confidence Boost Mode** – Turns insights into an achievable next-step plan (no overwhelm)  

## Why This Requires a Purpose-Built App

General AI tools provide guidance in isolated interactions, but learning improvement needs structure, repetition, and progress over time.
A dedicated app can manage structured inputs, apply consistent scoring, track changes, and guide students through a repeatable scan → explain → upgrade → track workflow—turning one-off advice into a reliable learning system.

## Who This Is For

- High school and college students choosing what to learn next  
- Bootcamp and certification learners building job-ready skills  
- Students feeling uncertain about whether their skills will stay valuable  
- Career explorers who want future-proof learning paths  

## Prompt Used

> Build a Gen Z-friendly education app using Google App Studio that takes a student’s current and planned learning path, extracts skills, compares them against projected 5-year job market demand trends, detects skill obsolescence, and outputs personalized, actionable upskilling/reskilling recommendations in a motivational, mobile-first experience.

## Tools Used

- Gemini + aistudio.google (ideation + prompting)  
- Google Stitch (UI design and prototyping)  
- Google Opal (UI design and prototyping)  
- Replit (UI design and prototyping)  
- Base44 (UI design and prototyping)  
- Kimi (UI design and prototyping)  
- Rocket (UI design and prototyping)  
- Google AI Studio (Gemini 2.5 Flash)  
- React + TypeScript  
- Material Design principles  

## Action Plan (for Building + Iteration)

### Action Steps

1. **Onboarding:** capture student goal (role/industry), timeframe, current learning plan  
2. **Skill Extraction:** auto-extract skills from courses + allow manual edits  
3. **Market Mapping:** label skills as emerging / stable / declining using 5-year demand signals  
4. **Obsolescence Score:** calculate a “Future-Proof Score” and explain it in simple language  
5. **Plan Upgrade:** recommend 3–5 high-impact changes (swap, add, level-up)  
6. **Interactive Optimizer:** let students pick recommendations (swipe/choose) to build a final plan  
7. **Progress Tracking:** weekly check-ins + streaks/badges to keep motivation high  
8. **UX Validation:** ensure “scan → recommendations” can be completed in under 2 minutes  
9. **Privacy Check:** minimal data collection, clear consent, and a visible delete option  

## Gen Z UX Notes

- Mobile-first layout with fast inputs (minimal typing)  
- Motivational tone (no fear tactics—clarity + empowerment)  
- Gamified progress (streaks, badges, “future-proof score”)  
- Short explainers, visual signals, and swipe-friendly decisions  

## Privacy & Data Safety

- Collect only what’s necessary (learning plan + goals)  
- Clear consent for saving profiles or history  
- Transparent settings and easy data deletion  
- No sharing with third parties by default  

## Output Format

### Skill_Scanner_insights
- [Emerging skills relevant to the student]
- [Declining/obsolete skills detected]
- [5-year demand direction by skill/role]
- [Skill gaps to close]

### action_steps
- [Top 3 recommended skills to add]
- [Top 3 skills to de-prioritize]
- [Suggested projects/certifications to prove skills]
- [30-day learning plan starter]

### summary
A clear, motivational recap of what to change in the learning path and why it matters.

## Time to Build

⏱️ 30–45 minutes (concept → working prototype)

## Revenue Potential

- **$5–15/month per student**
- Semester-based subscriptions make sense for learners  
- Strong B2B potential for schools, bootcamps, and career centers  

## Summary

**Skill_Scanner** helps students stop wasting time on outdated skills by scanning their learning path against projected 5-year job demand. It delivers clear market insights, personalized recommendations, and an interactive learning-plan optimizer designed to boost motivation and career confidence.
